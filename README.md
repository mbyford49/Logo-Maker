Logo-Maker!

This is a simple command line application that will generate a logo based on the users response to a series of promts. These include logo text of up to three characters, text color, logo shape and logo color. The generated logo will then be saved as an SVG file. This application uses the NPM package inquirer to prompt user input, and the jest package for testing.

To use this application you will run the following commands in the command line.
- npm install  This will install the NPM packeges used in this application.
- node index.js  This will start the series of prompts to design and generate the logo.
- npm test  This will test to ensure the app is running correctly.

Here is an example of what the logo may look like.
